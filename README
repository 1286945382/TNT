This is the Thumb2 Newlib Toolchain project providing a script to compile the latest GCC with Newlib and optimizations for microcontrollers.

So far it only has been tested on OSX, Debian and NetBSD, feel free to push changes for your OS. Download prebuilt binaries for Linux and OSX here: http://eliasoenal.com/2012/10/11/the-power-of-tnt-is-at-your-disposal/

8/24/2013 - Additional optimization option preferring speed over size

6/5/2012 - TNT has been updated to the latest Linaro GCC 4.7
6/22/2012 - Switched to a GCC 4.8 snapshot and disabled LTO for newlib due to regressions
8/29/2012 - Switched to the latest Linaro GCC for minor size improvements, also configured newlib with "reent-small" for 800byte savings in .data
