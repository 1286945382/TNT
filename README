This is the Thumb2 Newlib Toolchain project providing a script to compile the latest GCC with Newlib and optimizations for microcontrollers.

So far it only has been tested on OSX, Debian and NetBSD, feel free to push changes for your OS. Download prebuilt binaries for Linux and OSX here: http://dekar.wc3edit.net/2012/10/11/the-power-of-tnt-is-at-your-disposal/
